## Introduction
Emotion recognition from facial expressions is a crucial task in computer vision with potential applications in a variety of fields, including human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing. This project explores deep learning for emotion recognition from facial expressions, comparing state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets. It offers insights into model design and potential research directions.
## key skills used
**Deep Learning , Computer vision, Data analytics** 
## Methodology
* In the proposed system it uses a approach of the analysis of video segments using Neural Networks which involves extracting visual information in the form of feature vectors.
* In this project,  propose a deep learning-based approach to detect emotions from images captured by surveillance cameras in a supermarket.
* This approach involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large dataset of annotated facial images to recognize seven basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, neutral and fearful).
* Then apply the trained model to real-time video streams to detect and classify emotions of customers in the supermarket.
* The result is stored in the **output.txt** file which is then can be used for data analysis purpose to derive a retail insight.
